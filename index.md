# There is a large book in front of you.
On the cover you see its title, **The Book of Loops**, as well as some words:

> Hello! I am a book that changes with every reading.
> 
> In order to find passage through my pages you will need to bring a question with you. The question should be about something you currently find to be both personally important and weirdly fuzzy. It can be related to a recent experience, a relationship, a project, about something mythical and mysterious, or anything else that comes to mind.
>
> *When you have a question in mind, open me.*
