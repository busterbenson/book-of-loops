# You inspect the book.

On the cover the Book of Loops, are the words:

> The price for passage through my pages is a question that you don't know the answer to. It could be related to a recent experience, a relationship, a project, or about something mythical and mysterious. When you have a question in mind, open me.

[[Open the book]].

[[Leave the book alone]].
