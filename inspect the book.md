# You inspect the book.

On the cover of **The Book of Loops** are some words:

> Hello! I am a book that changes with every reading.
> 
> In order to find passage through my pages you will need to bring a question with you. About something you currently find to be both important and fuzzy. The question could be related to a recent experience, a relationship, a project, or about something mythical and mysterious. Whatever you are currently unsure about.
>
> When you have a question in mind, open me.
