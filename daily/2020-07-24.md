I have become fascinated by the I Ching, and also frustrated with that dearth of entry level books, videos, and general information about it. At least, in English. 

I'm reading "I Ching: The Book of Changes and the Unchanging Truth" and it's the closest and best I've found so far. The first half is a historical overview of the I Ching, and goes into pretty good detail. It opens like this:

> The Book of Changes, also referred to as the I Ching, is an ancient work completed by the wise King Wen, a feudal lord, in the last generation of the Shang Dynasty (1766-1121 B.C). People who recognize this as a remarkable work of profound wisdom might also want to know how the ancient ones developed their integral vision of all aspects of life.

It feels dry but thorough; accessible, but not super fun. And yet, my experience of I Ching has been much more on the playful and fun side of things. It's rich in imagery, stories, and a simple but profound sensibility at the core. 

The origin story is fun. I wonder if there's a danger of disrespecting the text if I tried to modernize it. I see this happening in Tarot quite a bit, but not with I Ching at all. It would have to be done respectfully, obviously, and make a proper distinction between adaptation and remixing.
