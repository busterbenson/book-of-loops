# You open the book.

Thinking of something you'd like to offer to the book, you decide to open the book. The cover happily swings open. 

The first page says:

> Hello, I am the Book of Loops.
> I'm not like most books. Instead of reading me, we will have a conversation. 
> Every good conversation begins with curiosity.
> I have a few questions I'd love to ask you. 
> Are you okay with that?

[[interview start|Yes, I am]].
