trigrams: Fire over a lake.

interpretation: The fire is rising and the lake is falling, which represents a growing separation between parties involved. And yet, it's through this separation that collective well-being is preserved, because each is able to move with integrity in their own way.

advice: Respect alternate points of view. Energy is generated by the tension created by the proximity of fire and water. Channel it creatively rather than destructively. This may not be easy to do, but it is the right thing to do because it will lead to mutual growth.

characters: The cat is feeling foolish, the turtle is feeling victimized, and the raven is feeling heroic.

fable: TBD
