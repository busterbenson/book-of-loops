A lake at the top of a mountain.

The mountain is the perfect complement to the lake that reflects it's image reversed. The world is now perfectly prepared to support your weaknesses and give you space to express your strengths. 

The recommendation of this hexagram is to take the initiative to welcome people in and to be vulnerable.
