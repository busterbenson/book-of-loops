interpretation: The thunder represents movement and the sky represents strength and reach. Together this represents an opportunity to display great power, if you choose to use it. 

advice: There is great power crackling in your fingertips like lightning bolts. That doesn't necessarily mean that you should use it, but it should at least be acknowledged and considered as something you must manage. Combining this power with equally great wisdom could benefit everyone involved.

characters: The cat and turtle are afraid, and the raven is enlightened.

question_one: 
line_one: With wavering intuition, this great power is accompanied by shaky uncertainty, like standing too long on your tippy toes. While your power is great, you may be constrained by other force entirely. Rather than leaping to take advantage of the immediate opportunity, play the longer game with [[hexagram 001110|consistency]] and try to re-connect with what you truly believe is the case.
