trigrams: Thunder booming across the sky. 

interpretation: The thunder represents movement and the sky represents strength and reach. Together this represents an opportunity to display great power, if you choose to use it. 

advice: There is great power crackling in your fingertips, like lightning bolts. That doesn't necessarily mean that you should use it, but it should at least be acknowledged and considered as something you must manage. Combining this power with equally great wisdom could benefit everyone involved.

characters: The cat and turtle are feeling victimized, and the raven is feeling heroic.
