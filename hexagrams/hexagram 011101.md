summary: Fire in the lake. Water extinguishes fire, and fire dries up water. The image of metamorphosis. Each changes the other. Mutually incompatible forces are in dialogue.

characters: The cat is feeling victimized. The turtle is being a fool. The raven is playing the hero.

story: Turtle started a fire on a small island in the middle of a lake. Cat hates both fire and water, and gets mad at Turtle for doing this without thinking of her. Raven puts the fire out by dipping into the lake and flapping his wet wings violently above the fire, stirring up a lot of mud, smoke, and ash onto Cat's fur and into Turtle's mouth and eyes. The fire is out but they are now unrecognizable.

dilemma: A big error is thought to be made, but forgiveness is fully extended after the fact when it turns out to have been a necessary mistake.
