summary: Fire in the lake. Water extinguishes fire, and fire dries up water. The image of metamorphosis. Each changes the other. Mutually incompatible forces are in dialogue.

characters: The cat is feeling victimized. The turtle is being a fool. The raven is playing the hero.

story: Turtle, Cat, and Raven were in a small wooden boat floating in a lake. Turtle, growing cold, started a fire in the boat. Cat, fearing water almost as much as fire, gets mad at Turtle for burning their boat. Raven puts the fire out by dipping into the lake and flapping his wet wings violently above the fire, stirring up a lot of water, smoke, and ash into the boat and onto Cat's fur and into Turtle's mouth and eyes. The fire is out but they are now unrecognizable.

dilemma: A big error is thought to be made, but forgiveness is fully extended after the fact when it turns out to have been a necessary mistake.
