trigrams: A forest submerged in a great lake.

summary: The trees in the lake are outgrowing their existing container. There's a lot of pent up energy, and cracks in the wall of the container that are about to bust open with the raw energy of life. 

advice: The hexagram recommends letting this energy flow by its own power, and following it, because it is mature and ready. It’s time to stop holding back.

characters: The cat, turtle, and raven are all playing their heroic forms, and merge to form a chimera.
