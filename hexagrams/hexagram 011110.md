A forest submerged in a great lake.

The trees in the lake are outgrowing their existing container. There's a lot of pent up energy, and cracks in the wall of the container that are about to bust open with the raw energy of life. 

The hexagram recommends letting this energy flow by its own power, and following it, because it is mature and ready. It’s time to stop holding back.
