interpretation: There are some shadows rising and taking shape, intimidating in size like a mountain looming on the horizon. Rather than engaging with these shadows directly, subtly withdraw and watch them, curious about how they evolve, but they're not yet receptive to a dialogue.

advice: The timing isn't quite right to engage with the growing discomfort. Better to patiently wait for a time when it finds its own voice and speaks up.

characters: The cat and turtle are brave, and the raven is enlightened.
