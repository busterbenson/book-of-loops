quotes: ['']

trigrams: The winds are favorable.

interpretation: Wind represents activity of the mind, slowly but persistently getting to the heart of something. There may be something that feels a little bit off, but this wind can help it bend back into a more fitting shape if you let it. 

advice: Don't jump to conclusions. Be patient and stay undecided and open as you gather more raw information and mull things over. Even if that's a bit scary. Only settle on a decision once you feel like you've truly internalized the question from all angles.

characters: The cat and turtle are feeling heroic. The raven is feeling a bit monstrous.
