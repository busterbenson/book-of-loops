quote: '"Often the I Ching uses this hexagram to show us that we should not
be asking this question." -- D.F. Hook'

interpretation: The mountain blocks our path, and the small spring at the foot of the mountain gives us false hope that we can make the journey. Together, this suggests that we have a perilous journey ahead of us, and lack the experience needed to make it safely.

advice: You might be asking the wrong question. Instead of trying to answer this question, consider asking it in a different way, or looking at it from a different angle. If that doesn't help, it might be best to drop the question for now and try again at a later time.

characters: The cat is confident, the turtle is afraid, and the raven is endarkened.
