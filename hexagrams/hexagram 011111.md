Platypus made a home in Turtle's lake. It had taken a long time to make this home feel just right. Now, everything was almost perfect, except that the lake had started to dry up. Turtle was worried that their entire habitat would be lost and that there was nothing they could do. 

Platypus: "The lake is getting smaller but the land is getting bigger. It's time for us to adapt to the situation and move our homes to land. There's more than enough for us up there, especially if we move there now while we're still thriving, and before everything here runs out."

Turtle: "I love this lake too much. I can't leave everything I've ever known and start over like that."
